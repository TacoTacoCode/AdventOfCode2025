# Day 1

We can think that the arrow rotate is actually a cursor moving on a straight line, and all the mark 100, 200, -100, -200 are representing for 0 mark.

#### Part 1

-   Just calculate the final position of the cursor, if it is either -100, 100, 200.. means the arrow is actually stop at 0

=> count when remainder after divided by 100 is 0

#### Part 2

-   Simply add count every time we cross those 0 representers, include case where we cross 0 and minus 1 if it stops at a representers (since we already count it)

# Day 2

#### Part 1

-   Simply check left half equal right half

#### Part 2

-   It is a common question in Math problem (I guess) - how to know if a string is a repeated pattern
    -   One way is use very popular check, if that string is repeated, we just need to append it self and remove head tail to eliminate the chance it repeat as left half or right half. If that new string contain the original, it is a repeated pattern
        ```
        (s + s).Substring(1, 2 * s.Length - 2).Contains(s)
        ```
    -   The other way, which is what i use, is just pure brute force, find all posible pattern and build the new string to check if it is same with original.

# Day 3

#### Part 1

-   2 digits are kinda simple, I firstly use an array to store biggest number for each tens digit (array index 5 will store the highest 5x). Then just a 2 cursor big loop

#### Part 2

-   For 12 digits, we cannot do that, since there are too much loops to check. We know that, it must be the biggest number and also most left posible one (since the order must not change). For example, if I want to get the first digit, start from 9, I have to check if from index of 9, do I still have enough number to build 12 digits. If yes, take that 9, if not, reduce to 8

# Day 4

#### Part 1

-   Today is kinda simple, using Complex type to hold row number and column number, then for every position I just count the surrouding by add the direction

#### Part 2

-   Well, just doing the same as P1 untils we can't do, so just another loop and a counter, remember to exlcude the rolls which are removed in every loop

---

# Day 5

#### Part 1

-   Kinda easy, parsing and just 2 loops check to see if a ingredient is in any range or not

#### Part 2

-   To count total number in all ranges, we should clean up/combine all range first. Just need exrta list to hold new combined ranges, with some logic for the contain or overlap and we are done.

# Day 6

This is a special day, I use excel to do it

#### Part 1

-   Transform the input to csv file, just need to replace all space using VSC regex replace `(\s){1,}`, then import to excel and with some formular, we are good

#### Part 2

-   With the hype of excel, this is a little bit tricky, but, excel allows us to flip the data from horizontal to vertical, all we need to do is split the current input as their correct position. Use this regex `(\s)?` to split all by a tab and import to excel. The formular is hard, so I have to ask my "friend" for help.
-   One side node is we can still implement a program for this problem. You only need to notice that at the operator line, the position of a operator is begining of its block, so we only need to split the input by block and yeah everything will be easy.

---

# Day 7

#### Part 1

-   Recursive and a list to store all the _new_, touches splitter.

#### Part 2

-   Where we need to count all the path that could be generated by one spliter. Just simple dynamic programing, you can change the list from part 1 to a dictionary to hold the count by each spliter
